# A toolbox of functions to help you theme Drupal sites.

Code snippets and documentation for dominating the theme layer and creating efficient, extensible and not least submissive markup.

## Injecting classes
Most of these functions are intended to inject classes for styling into your Drupal site to allow for a more object oriented approach to CSS.

## Expanding template suggestions
Secondly the functions expand on Drupal core's template suggestions and give examples of how to insert custom template suggestions to streamline the number of tpl.php-files in your theme.

## How to use it
 - Copy the functions you need to your template.php
 - Replace any instance of THEMENAME with the system name of the theme.
 - Replace any instance of MENU_NAME or FORMID with the system name of the menu or formID of the form.
 - Adapt, remove or combine conditions as your design dictates.
 - Remove all unneeded code.
