A reasonable understanding of how they work are really recommended even though just pasting code would probably work 8 times out of 10.\r\n\r\nHere is some suggested reading:\r\n- Render Arrays in Drupal 7: http://drupal.org/node/930760\r\n- The Scary Render Array by Erik Stielstra: http://cocoate.com/ddbook/scary-render-array\r\n\r\n## Mostly Consistent (and Harmless)\r\nThe structure of your render arrays will often vary depending on your base theme and installed modules. Themes like Omega and modules like Context change the structure of the render arrays.\r\n\r\n### Inspect render arrays\r\nRemember you can always inspect render arrays.\r\n\r\nThe best way to do this is to install and enable Devel module (drupal.org/project/devel). This allows you to print out nicely formatted render arrays with either:\r\n\r\n- kpr($vars) that prints out the information when the function is run, or\r\n- dsm($vars) that prints out the information in the Drupal messages.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\nContributions by:\r\n- Jesper Kristensen: Cableman - https://github.com/cableman\r\n- Marek Sotak: Mareksotak - https://github.com/mareksotak\r\n","google":"UA-39544499-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
